# kaggle competition

利用kaggle數字辨識比賽所提供的資料，搭配深度學習演算法建立cnn&dnn模型，最後也得到14%的成績。因為這是一個傳統的問題所以也有許多前人的方法可以參考，對於圖片處理也有很大的收穫。

# Competition Description

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, your goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images. We’ve curated a set of tutorial-style kernels which cover everything from regression to neural networks. We encourage you to experiment with different algorithms to learn first-hand what works well and how techniques compare.

# Practice Skills

Computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks
Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors
